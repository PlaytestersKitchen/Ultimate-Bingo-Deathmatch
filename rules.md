###**Setup**
* Each player selects a player BINGO card, a set of BINGO dice, and 40 score cubes
* Each player sets their starting health to 3 by placing score cubes in the health boxes
* Randomly select a player to go first and give that player the **First Turn** marker
* Each player starts with the following items face up in front of him:
  * Basic Lazor - Activate: (2E) Target takes 1 Dmg
  * Basic Shield - Activate: (2E) Block 1 Dmg
  * Basic Battery - (Passive) Supply 2E. (Activate) Store 2E to a max of 4E

###**Objective**
* Ultimate Bingo Deathmatch Arena is part gunfight battle showdown, part race to make a BINGO. Score cubes on your BINGO card by rolling dice each round. Steal scored cubes from your opponents by reducing their health to zero. First person to score 5 cubes in a single row or column on their BINGO card wins.

###**Round Structure**

####1) Charge
* All batteries generate E as according to their passive charge rating. Set aside that many cubes at the start of the round from your cube pool

####2) BINGO
* Each player rolls their set of BINGO dice
* Based on the roll, each player places a cube from their pool on their BINGO grid in the appropriate column and row. This is called "scoring" a block
* If a block is scored on a colored grid, store an extra energy to your battery from your pool
* If a block would be scored on a space that has already been scored, store 2 energy to your battery instead

####3) Battle

**Select Item/Target**

On a three count, each player selects one of their 3 items (Lazor, Shield, or Battery) to use for that round
They must make the proper hand gesture to indicate which item they are using and their target if applicable:

* **Pre-count** - All players make a fist with one hand rested in a flat, upward facing palm with the other
* **Count** - While counting to 3, all players raises fist then drops fist into palm on the counts of 1 and 2
* **Select** - On the final count of 3, all players make the appropriate shape for which item they are using:
  * **Lazor** - Player makes a pistol shape with hand, pointing at target who will receive damage. That target takes damage as indicated by the item card used
  * **Shield** - Player sets palm flat and perpendicular to other palm as if chopping into palm. Any target is indicated by pointing with bottom hand fingers. Any received damage is modified as indicated on item card used
  * **Battery** - Player keeps hand in fist, resting it in palm of other hand. Battery card effects take place then any received damage applies to health in full

**Resolve Round**

* Starting with the player with the **First Player** token:
     1. Resolve any damage received
         * Any unblocked damage is deducted from player's health
         * If player is reduced to no health, he is killed. Resolve death immediately (see **Resolving Death**)
     2. Resolve spent E
     3. Store unspent E
     4. Purchase items and powers (optional)
* Repeat with other players in a clockwise rotation
* Once all players have gone, pass **First Player** token clockwise

**Resolving Death** 

* Damage is applied to player in turn order starting with **First Player** and going clockwise. Damage is first applied to shield then any remainder is applied to health.
* If health is reduced to 0 points, player is killed and respawns with full health. He chooses and rolls one of his two dice. The column or row indicated by the roll is then given to the attacker. Ex. If killed player chooses his letter die and rolls an N, then all the blocks scored on the N column are removed from his BINGO card and then scored on the attacker's card. 
* If multiple players attack and kill the same target, the killed player gets to decide which scored blocks each player gets, dividing them up as evenly as possible in turn order.
* Any blocks scored this way follow the same rules as in the BINGO phase.
